# Warp Drive

Warp Drive is an experimental playground in which I am implementing many concepts
and proposals that have been discussed for `ember-data`. This allows for early
iteration and experimentation to occur more easily.

It also means this project currently has no `semver` guarantees and should be
avoided for actual application usage at all costs.
