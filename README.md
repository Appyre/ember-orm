# Ember-orm

This is a **VERY WIP** experimental alternative to ember-data with better
 support for sparse, immutable, and lightweight records.

This project is going to attempt to closely parallel many of ember-data's
official public APIs so that conversion between them is possible. It will
likely never be seamless.
